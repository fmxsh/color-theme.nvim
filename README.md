Personal nvim color theme.

Purpose of making it a plugin is to modularize and to add features later if needed. For example an easy way to switch theme, or to apply different themes to different source files.

Requires treesitter. Does not use nvims own coloring.

## Features

### Dynamic colors

Tints the base color theme based on day of year, traveling the whole color wheel in a year.

The base theme thus just has to make sure the contrasts between the colors are good, and the specific coloring is adjusted by the script.

### Adjustment

Ability to adjust saturation and brightness of the base color theme, but this is a feature I have mostly forgotten about and don't use currently.

## Trivia

- Color is not my area of expertice, so there is a lot of AI help in this.
